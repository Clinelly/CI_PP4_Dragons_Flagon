## Design

### Colours
The colour palette was found on [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/). I chose a palette with a similar colour-scheme to the main logo of the website.
Blue buttons draw the eye of the user and uploaded cards have a parchment coloured background to fit the fantasy theme.

<details><summary>View palette</summary>
<img src="docs/palette.png">
</details>


### Fonts

The font chosen was Medieval Sharp from Google Fonts, as it resembles old-fashioned writing on a scroll. Cursive was chosen as a back-up font. 

### Structure

#### Website pages
The website was designed alongside standard principles to ensure users would be familiar with the layout. 
The header contains a navbar allowing users to navigate the main pages and to register/login. The navbar collapses to a menu on smaller screens.
A footer runs along the bottom of the webpages, promoting the website's social media links and more niche webpages.

Overall, the website has the following pages:
- A Home Page, providing the user with a brief description of the business. Buttons take the user to the Booking page and the Events page. Cards display user reviews and a button underneath takes users to the Review Submission page.
- An About Page, which provides the user more in-depth details about the website and the services it offers.
- The Gallery Page; which functions as a blog, allowing the site admins to publish photos/articles to the users. Clicking on a post enables users to comment on the posts.
- The Contact Page allows users to contact the site owners directly and provides direct contact details and a map to the business location.
- The Food & Drink page gives users a sample of what food/drink the tavern provides.
- The Games page provides users with a list of games the tavern has to offer.
- The Events page provides information about the regular events that take place at the tavern. A calendar provides users with dates and event names. Clicking on an event provides further details. Site admins can update/delete events.
- The User Panel page can be accessed from the header. It provides users with information about their bookings and their account information. By clicking on their booking, users can update or delete them.
- The Booking page can be accessed from the home page and allows users to book a session at the tavern.
- The Review Submission page is accessed from the home page and allows users to submit a review about their experience.

### Wave
WAVE was used to test the main webpages accessibility. I had issues with Heroku not connecting to the WAVE webpage and was unable to test any webpages that required authentication.

6 Errors were shown due to empty links in the footer. Instead of text, I used Font Awesome icons for the Social Media links.

### Heroku Deployment

[Official Page](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git) (Ctrl + click)
This application has been deployed from Github using Heroku. Here's how:

1. Create an account at heroku.com

2. Create an app. Give it a name such as ci-pp4-dragons-flagon (note: the name must be unique) and select a region. I set mine to Europe.

Heroku now charges for access to it's native postgres resources. I set up my project with [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/)

3. Go to elephantsql.com and create an account.

4. Go to your dashboard.

5. Select 'New Instance'.

6. Set up your plan: 
  - Give it a name (typically your project name)
  - Select the Tiny Turtle (free) package.
  - The Tags field can be left blank.

7. Select a Region (ideally, a data center located near you).

8. Click 'Review'.

9. Check your details are correct and click 'Create Instance'.

10. Return to the dashboard and click on the database instance name.

11. In the URL section, copy the URL to your clipboard.

12. Copy the database URL to your env.py file. It can also be set as an environmental variable in Heroku.

13. Install the plugins dj-database-url and psycopg2.

14. Run pip3 freeze > requirements.txt so both are added to the requirements.txt file.

15. Create a Procfile with the text: web: gunicorn dragonsflagon.wsgi.

16. In the settings.py ensure the connection is to the ElephantSQL database.

17. Ensure debug is set to false in the settings.py file.

18. Add localhost, and ci-pp4-dragons-flagon-clinelly.herokuapp.com to the ALLOWED_HOSTS variable in settings.py.

19. Run "python3 manage.py showmigrations" to check the status of the migrations.

20. Run "python3 manage.py migrate" to migrate the database.

21. Run "python3 manage.py createsuperuser" to create a super/admin user.

22. Install gunicorn and add it to the requirements.txt file using the command pip3 freeze > requirements.txt.

23. Disable collectstatic in Heroku before any code is pushed using the command heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 -a ci-pp4-dragons-flagon-clinelly.

24. Set the Config Vars in the Heroku app:
  - Your Elephant SQL Database.
  - Port 8000.
  - Your secret key.

25. Connect the app to GitHub, and enable automatic deploys from main if desired.

26. Click deploy to deploy your application to Heroku for the first time.

27. Click on the link provided to access the application.

28. If you encounter any issues accessing the build logs is a good way to troubleshoot the issue.
